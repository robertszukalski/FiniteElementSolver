Implementing a Finite Element Method (FEM) solver with a triangular mesh for beam deformation in Java involves several steps. Since this is an educational project, I'll outline a simplified approach that focuses on the core concepts without delving into highly complex FEM aspects. Keep in mind that a full-fledged FEM solver is quite complex and typically requires more advanced mathematics and programming.

### Step 3.2: Basic FEM Logic with Triangular Mesh

#### Understanding FEM with Triangular Mesh

1. **Mesh Generation:**
    - The beam is discretized into a set of triangular elements.
    - Each triangle's vertices represent nodes where the displacement and forces are calculated.

2. **Element Stiffness Matrix:**
    - For each triangular element, calculate the stiffness matrix. This matrix represents the element's resistance to deformation.
    - The stiffness matrix depends on the material properties (like Young's modulus) and the geometry of the triangle.

3. **Global Stiffness Matrix Assembly:**
    - The global stiffness matrix is assembled from all the individual element stiffness matrices.
    - This involves summing the contributions of each element to the nodes they share.

4. **Applying Forces and Boundary Conditions:**
    - Apply the point force to the appropriate node(s) in the mesh.
    - Implement boundary conditions (e.g., fixed nodes where displacement is zero).

5. **Solving the System of Equations:**
    - The equilibrium equation for the FEM system is \([K]\{u\} = \{F\}\), where \([K]\) is the global stiffness matrix, \(\{u\}\) is the displacement vector, and \(\{F\}\) is the force vector.
    - Solve this equation to find the displacement at each node.

#### Java Implementation Outline

1. **Define Classes:**
    - `Node`: Represents a point in the mesh with coordinates and displacement.
    - `TriangleElement`: Represents a triangular element with nodes and a method to compute its stiffness matrix.
    - `BeamMesh`: Represents the entire mesh of the beam, containing all nodes and elements.

2. **Mesh Generation:**
    - Define a method to create nodes and triangular elements along the beam.
    - Ensure the mesh is fine enough for the desired accuracy.

3. **Stiffness Matrix Calculation:**
    - Implement a method in `TriangleElement` to calculate its stiffness matrix.
    - Use the appropriate material properties and geometrical calculations.

4. **Global Stiffness Matrix Assembly:**
    - In `BeamMesh`, implement a method to assemble the global stiffness matrix from all elements.

5. **Force Application and Boundary Conditions:**
    - Add methods to apply forces to nodes and set boundary conditions.

6. **System Solver:**
    - Implement a method to solve the system of equations. You might use a matrix library (like Apache Commons Math) for handling matrices and solving the system.

7. **Main Solver Logic:**
    - In `FiniteElementSolver`, bring everything together. Generate the mesh, apply forces, set boundary conditions, and solve for displacements.

### Example Pseudocode

```java
public class Node {
    // Coordinates, displacement
}

public class TriangleElement {
    // Nodes, stiffness matrix calculation
}

public class BeamMesh {
    // List of Nodes and TriangleElements
    // Methods for global stiffness matrix assembly and system solving
}

public class FiniteElementSolver {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create beam mesh
        // Apply force
        // Set boundary conditions
        // Solve for displacements
        // Output results
    }
}
```

### Moving Forward

This outline provides a starting point. Each class and method would need detailed implementation based on FEM theory and Java programming principles. If you need more specific help with any of these classes or methods, such as detailed algorithms for stiffness matrix calculations or mesh generation, feel free to ask!
